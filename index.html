            <b>The beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday</b> (Steve Maraboli)
            <br>
            This statement bears weight in each of our own lives. Our past is significant not only to the present
            but also to the future. However, it does not define us. We ourselves are a collection of memories we 
            have made, experiences we have had and predicaments that we have encountered. As a result, our behaviour
            reflects these three aspects.
            <br>
            I believe that self-reflection is important because it takes into account
            our memories, experiences and challenges. Reflection takes you into a deep dive of seeing what lies in 
            you below the surface. It enables you to peel away layers and uncover truths that you have truly known 
            all along. Our subconcious minds are awakened and strengthened resulting in unlocking of the true power 
            that you hold within.
            <br>
            I invite you to travel on this journey with me as I dive deep to look withtin 
            myself. Gaze into the mirror with me, as I reflect. I hope that this experience can empower you to stop
            shying away from self-introspection and use self-reflection as a tool to empower your being.
