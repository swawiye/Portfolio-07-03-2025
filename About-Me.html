            <b><i>Who am I?</i></b>
            This simple sentence with three words is one which we have all encountered at least 
            once in our lives. Whether it was a question someone else prompted you to answer, or 
            a question that arose from your curiosuty and you had to answer it yourself. This 
            seemingly simple question calls for deep self-reflection. For a long time, I found 
            this question disturbing since unlike others, I did not have a concrete answer. I was 
            who I was, and I am who I am- that's what I thought the answer was for me. However, it
            is not. This question cannot be answered in a singular statement, it has many layers and 
            dimensions to it. One of the dimensions happen to be one's skills and interests.
